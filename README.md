Rajat Maheshwari
- I handled frontend of the Event Page and the pages for every individual event as well as the sponsor page
- I used fonts found online and were open source as fonts for my events Hackathon, Hack-A-Game and Gaming
- For animations, I read up online about how to make custom animations and then implemented them to create animations of entries, exits and hover effects
- I haven't used any libraries as such and implemented everything using HTML,CSS and JavaScript
- I used Event Listeners for window and document. The window event listener made sure that animations only played after page was loaded and the document event listener was used to display appropriate messages for confirmation of login when trying to register for an event.
